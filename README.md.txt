Description/Purpose: For this project, I worked on creating a Website for a restuarant in this case called "Bamboo Cafe. This website allows users to view the different sections of the restuarant such as Breakfast or lunch. Then it allows users to enter and order of a specific dish and will be identified by their entered name. 

Dependencies: PHP,HTML

Usage: This Project can be used to place orders at a restaurant and store the information given to keep for a company to keep track of orders.

Future Work: For future work, I would like to be able to enable a login feature so users can save their account for future orders so they won't need to enter name every time they place an order.

Major and Project Relation: I am an Information Systems major with a minor in Intelligence. This project is related to my major because of jobs in web development.
